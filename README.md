# Kniffel-probability-calculator
A simple program written in Python that calculates the average throws and probability of rolling a Kniffel (five dices w/ the same number of eyes) without selectively rerolling some of the dices

Probably horribly optimized, so feel free to optimize if you for some reason want to do that.
